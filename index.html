                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Born in what was Czechoslovakia, Jaromir started his hockey career from a young age, playing at the highest level in the Czech Republic at the age of just 15. 
                        He would end up being the 5th overall pick in the 1990 draft, and was the longest remaining player from that draft.
                    </p>

                        He won the Stanely cup twice, in '91 and '92, back to back while with the Penguins. Jagr won the Art Ross Trophy in '95, a trophy received by some of the greatest players in the history of the game like Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux.
